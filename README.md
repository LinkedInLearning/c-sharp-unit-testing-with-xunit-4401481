In this course, learn the basics of test-driven development by creating a sample project in pure C# and using unit tests to validate that all the business logic works.
Instructor Jesse Freeman first introduces you to the foundational concept of unit testing and the role xUnit plays in it. He then guides you through a detailed setup process of xUnit for your development environment. Jesse also delves deeper into the specifics of xUnit's function, benefits, and its core role in the test-driven development (TDD) cycle.

## Installing
If you don't already have .NET installed, you can get the .NET Core SDK from the official website or you can use Visual Studio, like I'll be using, for the Mac. Simply download install Visual Studio from the official site.
